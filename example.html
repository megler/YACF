                    <p>Born during the Golden Age of feline flight, Robert Falcon Morelli, or Bob as
                        his friends called him, was called to flight at an early age.</p>
                    <p>Fearless as a kitten, he would astound his playmates and terrorize his mother
                        by flying from the highest points he could manage.</p>
                    <p>While jumping from the top of the cabinets was great fun, Bob knew there were
                        greater heights to scale in his life.</p>
                    <p>His parents prayed this would be a passing phase in Bob's life, but much like
                        the Antarctic explorer he was named after, Bob knew he would not lead a life of quiet
                        mousing
                        desperation. He knew he was destined
                        for bigger and better things.</p>

                    <p>After graduating at the top of his class in high school, Bob enlisted in the Feline Naval
                        Academy. This is a super elite school for aspiring cat pilots and ship cats, mainly
                        because water is gross and no one wants to go.</p>
                    <p>Bob persevered, however, and was soon on the highway to the danger zone!</p>
                    <h5>Trouble!</h5>
                    <p>While trying to woo a local girl he met on leave, Bob was nearly expelled from the
                        Academy for taking dangerous risks to prove his cathood.</p>
                    <p>After doing too much catnip with his pals, Bob set out to prove to Callie he had the
                        right stuff to be an astronaut.</p>
                    <p>Though he nearly died, this made him a legend amongst his fellow pilots. From that day
                        forward, he went by the callsign "Rocket Cat."</p>

                </div>
                <div class="column col-span-3 col-span-6@m col-span-6@s">
                    <p>As he lept from the precipice of the refrigerator, Bob envisoned climbing aboard the cockpit
                        of a
                        fighter jet and proving to the world Beagles are overrated aviators.</p>

                    <h5>Redemption</h5>
                    <p>Though Callie dumped him for being an idiot, Bob managed to stay enrolled at the Academy and
                        compete in the prestigious Top Cat contest.</p>
                    <p>He easily won top honors and also his Captain's bars. Robert Falcon Morelli achieved his
                        dream!
                        He was now a naval fighter pilot! Take that, Beagle Brigade!</p>

                    <h5>Where is Rocket Cat Now?</h5>
                    <p>Bob has since retired from military service and now teaches at risk felines how to avoid
                        being
                        feral by learning to fly. You can reach Bob on his <a href="contact">Contact Page</a> and
                        learn
                        more about programs offered by his charity, "Give Cats the World."</p>
